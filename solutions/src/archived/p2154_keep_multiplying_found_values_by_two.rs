///
/// # 2154. Keep Multiplying Found Values by Two
///
/// You are given an array of integers `nums`. You are also given an integer `original` which is the first number that needs to be searched for in `nums`.
///
/// You then do the following steps:
///
/// 1. If `original` is found in `nums`, **multiply** it by two (i.e., set `original = 2 * original`).
/// 2. Otherwise, **stop** the process.
/// 3. **Repeat** this process with the new number as long as you keep finding the number.
///
/// Return *the **final** value of* `original`.
///
/// **Example 1:**
///
/// ```
/// Input: nums = [5,3,6,1,12], original = 3
/// Output: 24
/// Explanation:
/// - 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.
/// - 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.
/// - 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.
/// - 24 is not found in nums. Thus, 24 is returned.
///
/// ```
///
/// **Example 2:**
///
/// ```
/// Input: nums = [2,7,9], original = 4
/// Output: 4
/// Explanation:
/// - 4 is not found in nums. Thus, 4 is returned.
///
/// ```
///
/// **Constraints:**
///
/// * `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
/// * `1 <= nums[i], original <= 1000`
///
